# Part 1: Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Product:** Team Lunch App  
**Goal:** Help teams vote on where to go to lunch  

---

## 1. Suggest Restaurants or Styles
**User Story:**  
As a team member, I want to suggest restaurants or cuisine styles so the group has options to consider.  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Users can type in a restaurant name.  
- Users can type in a cuisine (‚Äúsushi,‚Äù ‚Äúpizza‚Äù) and the app suggests nearby restaurants.  
- Suggestions appear in a shared list.  

---

## 2. Distance & Time to Walk
**User Story:**  
As a team member, I want to know how far a restaurant is and how long it takes to walk so I can judge feasibility during a lunch break.  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Each restaurant displays approximate distance and walking time.  
- Distance is calculated from a team‚Äôs common starting point (e.g., office).  
- Users can filter by max walking time.  

---

## 3. Voting & Pile-On
**User Story:**  
As a team member, I want to vote for restaurants and support others‚Äô choices so decisions are collaborative.  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Users can cast a single vote per round.  
- Users can add their vote to an existing suggestion.  
- Votes update in real-time across the team.  

---

## 4. Dietary Restrictions
**User Story:**  
As a team member with dietary needs, I want the app to highlight which restaurants meet restrictions so I don‚Äôt waste time considering unsuitable options.  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Each team member can set dietary restrictions (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free).  
- Restaurants display indicators for which restrictions they support.  
- Restaurants that don‚Äôt meet restrictions are visually flagged.  

---

## 5. Restaurant Status (Busyness)
**User Story:**  
As a team member, I want to know how busy a restaurant is so I can avoid long waits.  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- App integrates with APIs (e.g., Google Maps, Yelp, or OpenTable) to show current wait times or crowd levels.  
- Restaurants display status like: ‚ÄúBusy,‚Äù ‚ÄúModerate,‚Äù or ‚ÄúLight.‚Äù  

---

## 6. Price Point
**User Story:**  
As a team member, I want to see price estimates so I can choose an option within my budget.  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Restaurants display $ / $$ / $$$ price tiers.  
- Users can filter suggestions by price range.  
- Users can vote specifically on price preferences.  

---

As a team, we want to see the voting results so we can quickly decide.  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- App displays winning option once voting closes.  
- Results can be sorted by: distance, price, votes, or ‚Äútimes visited.‚Äù  
- Random picker option (‚ÄúI feel lucky‚Äù) is available.  

---

## 8. Restrictions & Team History
**User Story:**  
As a team, we want to avoid repetition and set rules so our lunches stay varied.  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Teams can set restrictions: time limit, distance, or ‚Äúhaven‚Äôt been in X weeks.‚Äù  
- The app keeps a history of past lunches.  
- Users can review restaurants afterward (rating + comments).

- Ability to add/remove restaurants from the pool.  
- Changes sync across the team.  

---

## 10. Post-Lunch Review
**User Story:**  
As a team member, I want to leave reviews after lunch so future decisions are better informed.  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- After lunch, app prompts for quick feedback.  
- Ratings and comments are stored in restaurant history.  
- Aggregate ratings influence future recommendations.  

---

# Part 2: Design Doc (MVP, Finalized)

## 1) Overview & Goals
Help teams decide lunch in ‚â§3 minutes: propose options, vote, apply constraints (time/price/dietary/cooldown), record history, and display the winner.

**Non-goals:** chat integrations, reservations, payments, expense features.

---

## 2) System Architecture

**Client**  
- Next.js (App Router, RSC where helpful), React 18, MUI 6  
- SWR/React Query for client data fetching & cache  
- Responsive + a11y; automatic **dark/light** mode

**Server**  
- Next.js API routes under `/api/*`  
- Supabase Auth (JWT)  
- Supabase Postgres (RLS)  
- Server-side calls to Yelp / ORS (keys never exposed)

**Data flows**  
- Client ‚Üí API routes (authorized) ‚Üí DB or external APIs ‚Üí response  
- Distance matrix results cached; Yelp results cached (1h) keyed by `term+geo`  

**Deployment**  
- Vercel (Preview on PR, Production on main)  
- Env secrets via Vercel project settings

**Observability**  
- Vercel Analytics + Supabase logs

---

## 5) API Contracts

All responses application/json. Errors: { error: { code, message } }.

Teams

POST /api/teams
Body: { name, defaultLocation: { lat, lng } }
201 ‚Üí { id, name, defaultLocation }

GET /api/teams/:id
200 ‚Üí { id, name, defaultLocation, members: [...], recentSessions: [...] }

POST /api/teams/:id/members
Body: { email } (adds existing user or invite stub)
200 ‚Üí { teamId, user: {...} }

DELETE /api/teams/:id/members/:userId
204

Sessions

POST /api/sessions
Body: { teamId, maxWalkMinutes, priceMin, priceMax, cooldownDays }
201 ‚Üí { id, status:'draft', ... }

POST /api/sessions/:id/open ‚Üí 200 { status:'open' }

POST /api/sessions/:id/close ‚Üí 200 { status:'closed', winner: {...}, ranking:[...] }

GET /api/sessions/:id/results ‚Üí 200 { ranking:[{ suggestionId, score, breakdown, details }], winner }

Suggestions

POST /api/sessions/:id/suggestions
Body: { type:'restaurant'|'style', label }

If style, server queries Yelp near team office, upserts candidate restaurants, and returns top N.
201 ‚Üí { suggestion: {...}, expanded?: [{...}] }

Votes (visible)

POST /api/sessions/:id/votes
Body: { suggestionId } (idempotent; last write wins)
200 ‚Üí { userId, suggestionId, tally: {...} }

GET /api/sessions/:id/votes ‚Üí 200 { votes:[{ user:{id,name}, suggestionId }], tally:{ suggestionId: count } }

Reviews & History

GET /api/history?teamId=... ‚Üí 200 [{ restaurant, visitedAt, ratingAvg, timesVisited }]

**Components**: `TeamSelector`, `SessionConfigurator`, `SuggestionSearchBar`, `SuggestionCard`, `VotePanel`, `SortControls`, `ResultsList`, `WinnerCard`, `ReviewDialog`  

**Theming (auto only)**  
```tsx
'use client';
import { createTheme, ThemeProvider, useMediaQuery } from '@mui/material';
import { useMemo } from 'react';

export default function Providers({ children }) {
  const prefersDark = useMediaQuery('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)');
  const theme = useMemo(
    () => createTheme({ palette: { mode: prefersDark ? 'dark' : 'light' } }),
    [prefersDark]
  );
  return <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>{children}</ThemeProvider>;
}
```
